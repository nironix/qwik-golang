ASSIGNMENT

1. Declare 2 variable of type INT and find the average of 2 INT numbers and return as FLOAT32 value
a) Print value and type of 2 variable.
b) Do explicit type conversion and print the average and type of output.
2. Using Decision making statements
a) Check if the 2 variable of type INT is divisible by each other. (Only if)
b) Check if the variable of type INT is even or odd. (If else)
c) Check if the 2 variable of type INT is greater than 200 and print output. (Nested if)
d) Take an input of type INT from user and Print the grades of Students. (If else ladder)
3. Using Loops
a) Take an input of type INT from user and Print the numbers divisible by that input btw 1-50.(Simple for)
b) Take an input of type INT from user and add 50 to each number and print the output. (For with condition)
c) Declare 3 numbers inside INT array, add each element of array to each other. (Range for loop)
4. Switch Statements
a) Take an input of type INT from user and Print the Day of week according to input.(Switch case)
b) Take an input of type INT from user and Print if person is eligible for voting.(Goto statement)
